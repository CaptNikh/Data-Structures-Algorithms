### Facts About Prime Numbers

- 2 and 3 are only consecutive numbers that are prime
- Two is the only prime number
- Every prime number can be written as 6b+1 or 6n-1, except 2 and 3 where n is a natural number
- **GoldBach Conjecture :** Every integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes

  
## Important theorems used in questions related to Primes -


- Square Root to find Primes
- Sieve Algorithm (Preprocessing method. After implementing, we can answer if a no is prime or not in O(1))
Flaw : Max size array that we can create is of the range 10^8. Hence, we cannot use sieve algorithm for large constraints greater than that. This is where segmented sieve comes in.

- Segmented Sieve
- Sieve of Atkins

(Usually in the case of queries, sieve concept is used.)

- Examples of Variations of Questions in Sieve
- Lowest Prime & Highest Primes
- Prime Factorization (V Imp) [Max No of Prime Factors : log n base 2]
- Divisors variation in sieve
- Counting Divisors Faster
